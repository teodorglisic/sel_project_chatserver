# Chat Server

This project is an implementation of a simple chat server, using a RESTful protocol with JSON. It should have companion
repositories for compatible clients.

The repository is currently private, because the students have the job of implementing a compatible server and/or
compatible clients. And we don't just want to see our code with variables renamed...

## Documentation

Documentation is included in the repository, in LibreOffice format.

## Running the server

The server runs as a standalong Java application. By default, it uses port 50001.
